# Keras-Model-On-Google-Cloud
This is a series of notebooks intended as a tutorial for deploying a Keras model (a Convolutional Neural Network for Fashion MNIST) on Google Cloud using AI Platform Prediction. It includes the steps on how to get predictions from the model from a local Python client. It assumes a Google Cloud Account with a project and bucket created, the Google service account file created, and the proper dependencies installed on an Ubuntu machine.
